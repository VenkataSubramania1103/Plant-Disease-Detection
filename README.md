Introduction:
Plant Disease Detection is an innovative machine learning project that harnesses the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep learning techniques to identify and classify diseases in plants. The primary objective is to offer farmers and agricultural experts a valuable tool for swift plant health diagnosis, facilitating timely intervention and minimizing the risk of crop loss.

Project Structure
The project comprises essential components:
Plant Disease CNN.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the code for model training.
plant_diseases_detection.py: Streamlit web application for plant disease prediction.
best_model1.h5: Trained model weights.
packages.txt: List of necessary Python packages.

User Guide:
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the repository:	
git clone https://github.com/VenkataSubramania1103/Plant-Disease-Detection.git
2.	Navigate to Project directory:
cd Plant-Disease-Detection
3.	Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4.	Run the streamlit application:
Python â€“m streamlit run plant_diseases_detection.py
5.	Once the application is opened, upload the leaf image in format of jpg, jpeg or png from the Browse files option
6.	Once the image is uploaded the uploaded image will display and the detection will be right to it.
